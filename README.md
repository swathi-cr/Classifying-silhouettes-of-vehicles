# Classifying-silhouettes-of-vehicles
Unsupervised Learning
Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.

Skills and Tools

Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification

Data Description:
The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different
angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double
decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This
particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the
bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it
would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.
Domain:
Object recognition
Context:
The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle,
using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed
from one of many different angles.
Attribute Information:
● All the features are geometric features extracted from the silhouette.
● All are numeric in nature.
